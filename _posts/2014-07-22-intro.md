Hello! I plan to use this blog as a little cache where I can tuck away things which I find interesting. This might include ideas of my own, summaries of papers, surveys of classical material, or just cool tidbits I learn from others. I'm sure the direction and tone will develop over time.

For the curious (and as a reminder to myself), I built this blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [So Simple Theme](http://mademistakes.com/articles/so-simple-jekyll-theme/). I'm hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). The math on this site is rendered through [MathJax](https://pages.github.com). The domain **.im** is the ccTLD for the [Isle of Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man).


> **Theorem** Blogging is cool.

**Proof:** Trivial.
