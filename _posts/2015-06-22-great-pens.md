A quality pen makes writing a joy. Sure, a cheap 10Â¢ BiC pen suffices for the mundane task of placing ink onto paper, but a pen which flows freely and naturally makes you *want* to write.  Here are a few things I look for in pens:

1. no dry "chunks" [^chunks] 
1. smooth "write-feel" without any "scratching" sensation
1. no bleeding, blotting, or smudging 
1. color with sharp contrast and no fading
1. good ergonomic feel

[^chunks]: For some pens, a strange dried-ink gunk can build up after repeated use. Maybe ball-point pens are at higher risk for this? 

Currently, I'm a fan of [uni-ball UM-151 0.38mm](http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Ink-Pen-0.38-mm-Green-Black/pd/314) and [uni-ball 207 Micro](http://www.amazon.com/uni-ball-Retractable-Pens-Micro-Point/dp/B001P1ZDTG).

Neither is particularly ergonomic, since they both have lightweight plastic bodies. But they both have amazing "write-feel". The 207 is particularly creamy.
