# research

During my Ph.D., I did research on applied probability, rare events, and connections to statistics and optimization. I was very fortunate to be advised by [Kavita Ramanan](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/ramanan/index.htm).

# perspective

I am broadly interested in applicable mathematics --- i.e., theory that can reveal new aspects of the world around us. The following (somewhat conflicting) viewpoints summarize my own perspective:

> "I regard as quite useless the reading of large treatises of pure analysis: too large a number of methods pass at once before the eyes. It is in the works of applications that one must study them; one judges their ability there and one apprises the manner of making use of them."
>
> — J.-L. Lagrange

and

> "Practical application is found by not looking for it, and one can say that the whole progress of civilization rests on that principle."
>
> — J. Hadamard
