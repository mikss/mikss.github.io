# research

During my Ph.D., I did research on applied probability, rare events, and connections to statistics and optimization. I was very fortunate to be advised by [Kavita Ramanan][kr].

   (w/ [K. Ramanan][kr])  
   Preprint, 2021.  
   [`arXiv:2105.04685`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04685)

1. *An asymptotic thin shell condition and large deviations for random multidimensional projections*  
   (w/ [Y.T. Liao][ytl] and [K. Ramanan][kr])  
   Preprint, 2020.  
   [`arXiv:1912.13447`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13447)

# teaching+

* 2014-2017, [Math CoOp](http://www.dam.brown.edu/people/ramanan/mathcoop.htm)
   - Some of us recently participated in the [STEAM Week](https://vimeo.com/143611780) at the Jewish Community Day School of Rhode Island.
* 2014-2016, ALANA Mentoring Program, Brown Center for Students of Color

# perspective

I am broadly interested in applicable mathematics --- i.e., theory that can reveal new aspects of the world around us. The following (somewhat conflicting) viewpoints summarize my own perspective:

> "I regard as quite useless the reading of large treatises of pure analysis: too large a number of methods pass at once before the eyes. It is in the works of applications that one must study them; one judges their ability there and one apprises the manner of making use of them."
>
> — J.-L. Lagrange

and

> "Practical application is found by not looking for it, and one can say that the whole progress of civilization rests on that principle."
>
> — J. Hadamard
