---

The graduate student seminar is back! The goal of this seminar series is to expose students to a broader view of applied mathematics, and to bolster the department's sense of community. Talks can be on any subject, but speakers are encouraged to be reasonably self-contained in order to appeal to a varied audience.

Time: **Mon, 12:00-12:50pm**.

Location: **170 Hope St., Room 108**.

Food will be provided by a (reimbursed) volunteer each week.

Organized by [Ian Alevy](mailto:ian_alevy@brown.edu), Xuefei Cao, Marshall Jiang, and Eirini Kilikian.
